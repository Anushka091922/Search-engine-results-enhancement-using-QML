# Search-engine-results-enhancement-using-QML
This is my final year project and it intends to enhance the results displayed by search engines and make it more and more relevant to the user search queries. for this very same project i am making use of quantum computing and quantum machine learning along with the traditional machine learning.

# Quantum Sementic field theory implementation:
Considering the two outputs: the first has a very high probability (0.7497) for one outcome, making the other outcomes practically negligible. This suggests overfitting or extreme confidence in one option, which might not be ideal for a search engine scenario. The second output, on the other hand, has a more even distribution, with no extreme peak. This could provide a more nuanced ranking of results, giving a better chance for relevance across different candidatesâ€”likely a better fit for the search engine's needs.
